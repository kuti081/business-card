                    Netlify is the platform developers love for building highly-performant and dynamic websites, e-commerce stores and web applications.

By uniting an extensive ecosystem of technologies, services and APIs into one workflow, Netlify unlocks new levels of team productivity, while saving time and money.

Our bet on Jamstack is quickly coming true. The web is rapidly changing away from monolithic to decoupled apps, and web developers are storming ahead with more power than ever. Netlify is built to cater to that movement, and in just a few years weâ€™ve on-boarded millions of developers and businesses, and are building and serving millions of web projects daily around the globe.

Fun fact: An estimated 16% of the internet population visits a website or web app on Netlify each month.
